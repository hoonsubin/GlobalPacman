# GlobalPacman

This is a simple Pac-man game I made with Unity and Mapbox. It allows the player to input a coordinate of a location, and the zoom level in which to render the map, then it spawns a yellow ball that can navigate through via mapbox's navigation API by clicking the point of interest.
Currently this is not a fully functional Pac-man as it does not spawn any dots to collect, or ghosts that follows the player.
